# Support Image Maker

While the images for many of the common Servants and CEs are present in the `image_SUPPORT` folder, you might want to use some other Servant/CE with `AutoSupportSelection`. You can use the script `_support_img_maker.lua` to create your own images.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Select the `_support_img_maker.lua` script in the AnkuLua app.
2. Open F/GO and go to Support Selection Screen.
3. Find the Servant or CE you want to make images for. Make sure the whole Servant + CE block is visible on screen.
4. Execute the script. It finishes almost immediately and the images are saved into a newly created `support_DATETIME` folder.  
   The generated images are black and white, but work fine. So, don't worry about that.
5. Move the images to `image_SUPPORT` folder and rename them as required.
6. Put the filename(s) in the options `Support_PreferredServants` or `Support_PreferredCEs` of the main script, accordingly.

We would appreciate any Pull Requests with useful Servants and CE images, especially for new events.

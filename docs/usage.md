# Usage
Please set your server region in `FGO_REGULAR.lua`:
```
GameRegion = "EN"
```
The possible values are:
- CN for China
- JP for Japan
- TW for Taiwan
- EN for USA

Put your game in either:
* Menu screen, make the quest you wanna farm as the 1st item on the screen (upper-right corner)
* Battle screen
* Results screen (first menu with or without bond level up)
* Support Selection screen

And start the script `FGO_REGULAR.lua`.

The script will automatically enter battle, choose cards for you, again and again until all AP are depleted.

See [Features](features.md) for the list of script features and their configuration.

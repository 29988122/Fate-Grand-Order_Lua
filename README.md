# Project Avalon
Project Avalon is an extension of [Fate-Grand-Order_Lua](https://github.com/29988122/Fate-Grand-Order_Lua), with the aim of using the processing power of PC to perform complex algorithm for the script, which cannot be handled by currently widely posessed mobile devices.

Note: This project is currently WIP and hence be aware of messy codes and bugs.

## Concept
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C4Zcmh4.png" width="400">

The main aim of using Avalon wrapper is to reduce the coupling of FGO_Lua and Project Avalon. By using this method, FGO_Lua can be developed independently from Project Avalon. Besides, users could use the standalone FGO_Lua scripts when the Avalon server isn't available.

The FGO_Lua folder holds the Lua codes factored out from the original FGO_Lua scripts. Pendragon folder holds the lua functions for REST API(in /pendragon/api.lua), as well as FGO module algorithms modifed to handle REST API.

## Installation
To run the Avalon features, Python 3.6 is required in your PC. Personally, I use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage my Python environments.

Next, install [Tesseract library for OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

Then, in Anaconda, create a Python 3.6 envirionment and install all the required packages in the /api/requirements.txt

Note: Put everything into your mobile device except the api folder which will stay in your PC.

## Usage:
Please choose the corresponding lua file in AnkuLua according to your:
* FGO server (supported China / Japan / Taiwan / USA currently)
    * FGO_CN_REGULAR.lua
    * FGO_JP_REGULAR.lua
    * FGO_TW_REGULAR.lua
    * FGO_EN_REGULAR.lua

In the lua file above, set ```Use_Avalon = 1``` to enable the Avalon features.

In the lua file /avalon/pendragon/config.lua, change the IP Address of ```Config.API_URL``` to your PC's local network IP. You can check you local network IP using [Fing App](https://www.fing.com/products/fing-app).

In /api/source, change the Tesseract related file settings ```pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd``` and ```tessdata_dir_config``` to your Tesseract installation folder.

Then, run the Python script called ```index.py``` in /api/source, using terminal/comand prompt or Python IDE such as [Liclipse](https://www.liclipse.com/).

## Features:
Currently, the only Avalon feature available is the detection of Stage, which enables Fate-Grand-Order_Lua to execute AutoSkills in any stages in battle. Instead of the need to start Fate-Grand-Order_Lua at Stage 1/3, you can run it at any stage such as 2/3 or 3/3 and have AutoSkills for that stage to be executed.

Currently, there are other features that are being planned such as Context Aware AutoSkill and Reinforced Learning Card Chaining. If you have additional idea implementations to contribute, please submit a pull request.

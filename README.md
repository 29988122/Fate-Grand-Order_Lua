# Fate-Grand-Order_Lua

As of 2017.11.20, this script is working WITHOUT ROOT / BEING BLOCKED, I DO NOT take responsibility for your banned account! 
```
(Alghough I highly doubt it, 
they really should not add extra detection method as it will only drag the game EVEN slower, 
let alone this script runs at human speed.)
```
This script supported TW, JP and USA server.

Screw those farming events - I only wanna enjoy the (kinoko) story!
Therefore I proudly brought you this: FGO automation script.

## Install:
1. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appautomatic.ankulua.trial
Download the latest version of sikuli framework here.

2. Enable usb debugging, connect your PC to android and execute run.bat inside ama\_daemon folder. After daemon has been installed, you can disable usb debugging and unplug. DAEMON NEEDS TO BE REINSTALLED UPON PHONE REBOOT.

3. Open ankulua to check if daemon is properly installed - and you're done.



## Use:
Please choice the corresponding lua file in AnkuLua accroding to your:
- FGO server (supported Japan / Taiwan / USA currently).
- Used in event or regular stages. 
Because sometimes events have extra window options to click, hence different version of scripts.
If there's no extra options for the current event during battle sequence, please use the regular one.

Then, put your game in either:
- menu, put your desired quest as the 1st item on the screen(upper-right corner).
- battle screen.

and click the transprent arrow. You're good to go.

I only update events in JP server, unless requested.

## Extra scripts:
* \_auto\_friendgacha.lua

As title. It will keep gacha until your bag's full.

* \_auto\_gift\_exchange

Use for Nero matsuri or Christmas events. Their UI really sucked.

## Behavior details:
- It is custoimized for events that I'm playing, hence some minor adjustments will be done frequently. **Remember to update!**

- Stamina does NOT automatically refilled, if you need to refill them automatically, please check [Auto refill](#auto-refill)

- Script sometimes stucked at certain screen - that's because FGO and delightworks SUCKED. If loading took too long, script will think it already finished loading and click when game's in fact not ready. Restart the script manually should suffice, or adjust all the wait() function in the .lua yourself. 3-5 seconds more would be enough. 

- Script automatically chooses weak cards, until "boss" fight.

- It will switch target to any "servant" or "danger" enemy, cast Noble Phantasm immediately and after until battle ended.

- Choose your party member wisely. Because this script does not do B/A/Q or brave chains, you have to observe the behavior of the script, and arrange your party accordingly in order to gain max clear efficiency / prevent party wipe from highest level event stage. 


## Auto refill:
If you really want to refill automatically, please modify the lua file you are executing(TW, EN or JP). 

There are 3 variables - Refill\_or\_Not = 0, Use\_Stone = 0, How\_Many = 0. 

You should change Refill\_or\_Not to 1 to enable the auto refill feature, Use\_Stone to 1 if you don't have enough apple (default Use\_Stone = 0 will use apple), and How\_Many to your planned refill rounds.

For example, Refill\_or\_Not = 1 Use\_Stone = 1 How\_Many = 3 will enable the auto refill feature, use stone 3 times, and stop at the "not enough stamina" screen, without using 4th stone.


## How to capture screen for recognition:
You can manually replace target\_servant.png inside image folder to customize your priority target.
1. screenshot your phone
2. convert it to png format
3. resize it to 1280 WIDTH (1920\*1080->1280\*720, 2560\*1440->1280\*720, etc.)
4. crop the desired pattern(ex: danger, servant, or particular enemy name) for the script to recognize.
5. replace target.png and test.
